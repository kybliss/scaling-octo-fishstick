## Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

This is a work day scheduler. The fields are modifiable, and upon clicking the save button, it saves the field contents. It uses jQuery to log the current time, and sets the CSS elements of the columns to grey, green, or red depending on the time.

## Credits

I sampled starter code from the class repository, and contributed to it with the guidance of an AskBCS Learning Assistant.
